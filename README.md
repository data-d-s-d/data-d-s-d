### Hello there! 😁

<!--
**data-d-s-d/data-d-s-d** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Im Diego and I'm a Data analyst. I live in Argentina, and fairly recently discovered Data analysis as a discipline. I have been wanting a change in my profesional career, and (luckily for me) the more i learned, the more i loved it!! 😋

I will be sharing mainly my code in SQL and Python 🐍

- 🔭 I’m currently working on visualizations with Tableau and big data bases with SQL 
- 🌱 Currently learning Python and literally everything I can about Tableau (I just love it 🤓)
