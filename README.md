### Hello there! 😁


Im Diego and I'm a Data analyst. I live in Argentina, and fairly recently discovered Data analysis as a discipline. I have been wanting a change in my profesional career, and (luckily for me) the more i learned, the more i loved it!! 😋

I will be sharing mainly my code in SQL and Python 🐍

- 🔭 I’m currently working on visualizations with Tableau and big data bases with SQL 
- 🌱 Currently learning Python and literally everything I can about Tableau (I just love it 🤓)
